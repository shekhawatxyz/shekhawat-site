* MathAcademy: 0/90 XP
* Programming: Finished chapter 1 of Learn Python Visually. The last exercise took a lot more than expected due to me not using a notebook to map the math out. Lesson learnt, calculating on the fly without a notebook is inefficient.
* Typing: 15 minutes on Ratatype.

### Reflection

On the 28th, I departed for semi-urban India, the logistics being bad on the first day is what caused me to skip last night's update as I got zilch done. Much better today.
